Q.how many ways we can configure bean in spring ?
=================================================
Ans:
	There are 3 different ways to configure a class as Spring Bean.

Method1:
-------
	XML Configuration. 
	The <bean> element tag is used in xml context file to configure a Spring Bean.

Method2:
--------
	Java Based Configuration.
	you can configure a Spring bean using @Configuration &  @Bean annotations. 

Method3:
---------
	Annotation Based Configuration.
	It facilitates @Component { @Service, @Repository and @Controller } annotations 
	

Very imp xml annotations:
_________________________
	<context:annotation-config />
	
	<context:component-scan base-package="com.chanti"/>

Note:

component-scan  Scans the classpath for annotated components that will be auto-registered as Spring beans. 
By default, the Spring-provided @Component, @Repository, @Service, and @Controller stereotypes will be detected.
