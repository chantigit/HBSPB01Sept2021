Jdbc:
=====
	Jdbc is an API
		1.java.sql
		2.javax.sql
		
	Used to perform 2 operations
		1.Establishing the connection between java app & Database
		2.Perform CRUD operations
		
Common Steps to write any JDBC Code:

I.Prepare a java class in File  (JdbcDemo1.java)
II.Import java.sql package
III.Prepare main() method & write following 6 steps

	Step1:Load the driver class 
	Step2:Prepare Connection object
	Step3:Prepare Statement object
	Step4:Prepare SQL query & send to Database
	Step5:Capture the result from Database & Print on console
	Step6:Close Connection & Statement objects

	
Drawbacks with JDBC:
--------------------
1.all are checked exceptions
2.boiler plate code 
3.jdbc uses sql, i.e database depedent
4.jdbc allow only textual info to persist into db

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Hibernate Framework:
=====================
	Hibernate is a ORM tool 
	Used to perform 2 operations
		1.Establishing the connection between java app & Database
		2.Perform CRUD operations
		
Adv of Hibernate over Jdbc:
==========================
1.all are unchecked exceptions
2.no boiler plate code 
3.Hibernate uses HQL, i.e database indepedent
4.Hibernate allow you to persist object into db

		
Common Steps to write any Hibernate Code:

File2  	: Mapping Xml File										(Student.hbm.xml)
File3  	: Configuration Xml File								(Student.cfg.xml)
File4	: Java Class with main() method to Test the application	(StudentTest.java)
